> This option will automatically update your installation even though you're not using the Microsoft Store!

> You may get an extra step in which you are asked to trust the **Lancelot Certificate, LLC** certificate. Just click or enter Yes to continue. This is unlikely to happen as I am a trusted publisher and Microsoft has my code signing certificate.
