# Development Release
This release is an **experimental** version that is built and packages using the new "Single-Project MSIX" approach. 

## Installation

1. Download this release's `msixbundle` file found in the **Assets** section below.
2. Double-click on the downloaded file.
3. Follow the Windows App Installer's instructions

## Support

Due to the highly experimental nature of this effort, there is no official support. However, it would be greatly appreciated if you could open an Issue so that I can work on fixing it in the next development build.
